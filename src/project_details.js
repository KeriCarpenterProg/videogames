  Keri Carpenter's Final Project
  I am a development manager at Sony Playstation.  Specifically, I own the team that creates
  the main product page.  Everyone who buys or plays a game on PS goes through my page.
  
  Thus, I am going to make a page that sort of looks like our game page.
  I found a publicly available Gaming API where I can connect and get game information and artwork.
  It is called https://www.igdb.com/.
  They also have individual game pages like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.
  https://www.igdb.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare
  My MVP project will seek to:
  connect to the database and pull down data and pictures on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Spider Man 2.
  Display the data in a page that looks similar to https://www.igdb.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare.
  Offer buttons at the top of the screen (like Playstation's Home Menu) that will
  switch between Call of Duty and Spider Man2.
  The two games were selected because they are both popular PS4 games and they
  had lots of available assets on the igdb.com API.

  If I have extra time, I will try to incorporate and display more games.

  ISSUES AND RESOLUTIONS
  add any issues and resolutions 
  I've done quite a bit of work on the project already.  I've probably put about 18 hours
  into it already and frankly, I'm really enjoying it.

  My HTML CSS looks bad right now so I will be working on that over the next week or two.

  I am fully connected with the database and am able to pull data, so I don't see that
  (thankfully) being much of a problem.

  However, I also haven't yet really referenced the fields in the HTML/CSS using javascript (it's
  just static hardcoded data right now).  I'll need to do that over the coming weeks.

  I have hired a tutor to meet with me each Sunday so 4 times over the coming 4 weeks
  to help get me unstuck when I get stuck.  I think that should be more than sufficient.

  I also will continue to make use of office hours to similarly get myself unstuck and
  keep going.

  Overall, I'm managing it like I manage my workload for my developers at work and I think
  it's a pretty solid project plan and not too ambitious as to get me overwhelmed to the 
  point I would just give up.

  I think I have enough time left, enough support, etc.  The only risk is if work gets
  intense or I can't get enough time away from work and family commitments to put in the time
  to do it.  That said, I'm really enjoying it and am super motivated to get this done so
  I don't think it will be a problem.
